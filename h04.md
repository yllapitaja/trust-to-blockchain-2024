### 1 Introduction
* Traditionally **trusted** third parties (banks etc.) are needed for monetary transactions online
* Paper proposes a p2p (peer-to-peer) cash system, which uses **cryptographic proof** instead of the trust-based model
    * => Wow! Now I got a better understanding of the mysterious and "cryptic" name of this course "From trust to blockchain" :)
### 2 Transactions
* Ownership of Bitcoins is transferred with digital signatures
* Double-spending problem with digital currencies
 
### 3 Timestamp Server
* Bitcoin requires a network of timestamp-servers that help to guarantee the chronological proof of transactions

### 4 Proof-of-Work
* Proof-of-work describes the way how new blocks are added to the blockchain
* In case of collisions, the longest chain represents the "truth"
### 5 Network
* The network consists of nodes, which verify the transactions
* The nodes broadcast to other nodes of the network
### 6 Incentive
* Nodes of the network are rewarded with blocks to maintain the network
* Transaction fees eventually replace block rewards

## Environment
* Host OS: MacOS Sonoma 14.7
* Host HW: MacBook Pro M1 Max, 64GB
* Virtualization: UTM
* Virtualized OS: Debian (debian-12.7.0-arm64-netinst.iso)

## a) Wallet. 
**Assignment:** Create a BitCoin testnet wallet. (For example, electrum)

**Answer:**
    # First installed electrum in Debian
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install electrum

    # Started the GUI (graphical user interface):
    electrum
    
Followed the GUI to create a new wallet 
1. My wallet name: **test_wallet_2024**
2. Kind: **Standard wallet**
3. Keystore: **Create a new seed**
4. Store the given seed (12 random English words) in a safe place
5. I left the password empty, since this is not real money
6. I created a backup of the wallet from File > Save Backup
7. File > Quit

## b) Faucet. 
**Assignment:** Get worthless fake money from a testnet Bitcoin faucet.

**Answer:**
1. Started Electrum with testnet: `electrum --testnet`
2. Created a new wallet, I called it "testnet_wallet_2024"
3. Picked the default options and stored the wallet-generation-seed in a safe place
4. After the wallet creation process finished, the Electrum GUI crashed and closed itself:

        electrum.bip32.InvalidMasterKeyVersionBytes: Invalid extended key format: 0x4b2430c
        qt.qpa.wayland: Wayland does not support QWindow::requestActivate()   
        QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running
        Aborted

5. Started Electrum with testnet again: `electrum --testnet` => No crash this time
6. Opened the Receive-tab, and requested 1 mBTC => noted down my **testnet address**
7. Opened a browser and Went to https:://coinfaucet.eu/
    * Selected "Bitcoin testnet3"
    * Pasted my **testnet address**
    * Got a message that they sent me bitcoins
9. Afer about a minute, I received **0.18506** mBTC to my wallet
10. NOTES!
    * Noticed that I couldn't make another request for 12 hours from the same IP address
    * I tried also from another network, but there was another error message: "Reached Hourly Limit. The site is temporarily down because hourly limit was reached"

## c) Giveway. 
**Assignment:** Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digists are 73.

**Answer:**
1. I went to the Send-tab
2. Inserted a testnet address (my own) to "Pay to"-field
3. Amount: 0.00473 mBTC
4. Clicked Pay..-button
5. Set "Fee rate" to zero (slide the bar to the left)
6. Got a message "Payment sent"
7. My balance suddenly increased to 0.02869 mBTC, so I was left confused at the end
8. The transfer was Confirmed after about 5 minutes

## d) Recycle. 
**Assignment:** Move the testnet money back to the same faucet you got it from.

**Answer:**
Still working on this... I'm stuck in getting just "Not enough funds" when I try to send more coins to others.

## e) Explorer. 
**Assignment:** Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions. Voluntary bonus: Use a transaction that's interesting, such as one related to a crime or other unusual event.

**Answer:**

## f) RogeCoin. 
**Assignment:** Critically comment on Honest Ads: If Cryptocurrency Was Honest ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUs5y9leCyA), about 5 minutes). Identify and list arguments made. Provide commentary to support and challenge each of the claims. If you can, provide references or real life examples to your claims. (This task does not require tests with a computer.)

**Answer:**
* Cryptocurrency is currently better as an investment than actual cash replacement.
* Cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be stable way of payment
* They require technical knowledge to operate with them
* Cryptocurrencies waste physical resources and they are heavy for the environment

## g) Voluntary: Bib39ers. 
**Assignment:** Write a bib39 phrase of a worthless wallet on a piece of paper. Hide it in your house to annoy thieves and others digging your stuff. Or leave it on a background of a photo and post it to social media. Optionally add or change a non-default word as an icing on a cake.

**Answer:**
