#### 2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography
* basic idea is that public-keys are shared and private keys are secret. Anyone can encrypt a message with a public key, but only the one(s) who have the corresponding private-key can read the message
    * Analogous to putting letter to a locked mailbox - anyone can put a letter in (~encrypt with a public key), but only authorized actors can read them (~private key).
    * Meanwhile, symmetric crypto-algorithm corresponds to a physical safe where even putting a letter in requires a private key.
* "public key cryptography" introduced 1976 by Diffie & Hellman (“New Directions in Cryptography,” IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, v. IT-22, n. 6, Nov 1976, pp. 644–654.)
* "hybrid cryptosystem" means that public-key cryptography is used only to secure and distribute symmetric **session keys**. Why?
    * public-key algorithms are slow. Symmetric algorithm can be even 1000 times faster
    * public-key cryptosystem is vulnerable to "chosen-plaintext attacks"
 * session keys are created only for temporary use, and deleted after communication has ended.

#### 2.6 Digital Signatures
* All digital signature algorithms base on public-key:
    * secret key is used to sign documents
    * public key is used to verify signatures
* You can use private key to digitally sign a full document
    * If A encrypts their message with their private key, anyone can decrypt it with A's public key, thus verifying that the sender was A
    * Timestamp is added to the digital signature to prevent using the encrypted document for malicious purposes like cashing digitally signed checks from bank.
    * This is a slow approach if the document is long
* You can use one-way hash-function speed up the signing process
    * A creates a hash of the document, and encrypts/signing it with their private key
    * A sends both the document and encrypted hash to B
    * B decrypts the hash with the public key, and compares it to the hash they have themselves created from the document => if they match, the signature is valid
* One-way hash-functions can also be used to add multiple signatures to one document, for example add both A's and B's signature
* "Repudiation" means in this context that someone claims that they didn't really sign a document. "Nonrepudiation" can be achieved by using a trusted 3rd party to verify timestamped signatures

#### 2.7 Digital Signatures With Encryption
* Combine signatures and encryption in this order
   1. Sign your document with your private key => the document now has your signature
   2. Encrypt the document with the receivers public key => only the receiver can decrypt it
   3. The receiver decrypts the message with their private key
   4. The receiver verifies the signature with your public key

#### 2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation
* Most random number generators are not secure enough for cryptography, since computers are deterministic machines
* Why it matters? A system can be attacked more easily if its cryptography is based on non-random sequence
* Characteristics of a cryptographically secure random-sequence:
   * uncompressable
   * unpredictable
   * cannot be reproduced = if you run the sequence generator twice with exact same input, output should be completely unrelated

### Rosenbaum 2019: Grokking Bitcoin    
    Digital signatures (8 sections, from "Typical use of digital signatures" to "Private key security")

* Typical use of digital signatures:
   * Example: Add a signature to your email about an attached document
   * Phases of signing and verifying:
      1. Preparation: a. create your own private key, b. create the corresponding public key, c. share the public key
      2. Signing: with your private key, create a signature of a document. Write a message (for example an email) and attach a document to it. Include the signature in the message.
      3. Verifying: the receiver verifies with your public key that the attached document is not corrupted    
* Improving cookie token security
   1. Create a keypair and share your public key
   2. Sign your message with your private key
   3. The receiver verifies the message with the public key
* Key pair reuse
   * "A key pair is created once. The same private key can be used several times to digitally sign stuff." 
* Two ways to use the key pair
   * Encrypt your messages
   * Digitally sign your documents
* John signs his payment
   * One-way hash function SHA256 => output is a 256-bit number
   * Hash is encrypted with private key
* Signatures in Bitcoin
   * Bitcoin uses the above kind of signatures for most payments, but it is not the only way to authenticate a payment
* Lisa verifies the signature
   * Verification can be done with the public key of the signer 
* Private key security
   * If you lose your private key, someone else can claim to be you and your information is compromised

### Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
* PGP encryption can be used with "gpg"-tool, for example on Linux command line
* GPG = GNU Privacy Guard
* Phases
   1. Create a keypair: `gpg --gen-key`
   2. Export public key: `gpg --export --armor --output key.pub`
   3. Import someone else's public key: `gpg --import friend.pub`
   4. Encrypt and sign a message: `gpg --encrypt --recipient friend@example.com --sign --output encrypted.pgp --armor message.txt`
   5. Send the encrypted message
   6. Receiver decrypts the message: `gpg --decrypt encrypted.pgp`
 
See all phases and troubleshoot tips from: https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/
  
## a) Pubkey today
    Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework. In addition to naming the system, identify how different parties use keys in different steps of the system. (Answering this question likely requries finding sources on your own. This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)

* I have used public key cryptography today while browsing the internet with HTTPS
* The website that has https:// in its URL has a verified signature that it has signed with its private key
* The traffic between my computer and their server is encrypted so that my computer enrypts the HTTP-packages with a session key and the server decrypts them with the same shared session key
## b) Messaging 
    Send an encrypted and signed message using PGP, then verify and decrypt it. (You can use folders to simulate users, or use two computers or two different OS users. Don't use Tero as a name of any party, unless that's your given name.)

I ran the experiment in my virtualization environment UTM, guest OS: Debian 12.

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc
* gpg --gen-key
* gpg --export --armor --output key.pub
* Write a nice message to a file: vi message.txt 
* gpg --encrypt --recipient friend@example.com --sign --output encrypted.pgp --armor message.txt
## c) Other tool
    Encrypt a message using a tool other than PGP. Explain how different parties use different keys at different stages of operation. Evaluate the security of the tool you've chosen.
* Didn't have time for this before the DL
* .
## d) Eve and Mallory
    In many crypto stories, Eve is a passive eavesdropper, listening on the wire. Mallory malliciously modifies the messages. Explain how PGP protects against Mallory and Eve. Be specific what features, which use of keys and which flags in the command are related to this protection. (This subtasks does not require tests with a computer)
* Protection agains malicious Mallory:
   * digital signatures to detect changes to messages
   * hash produced from the original text and encrypted with private key of the sender
   * Flags:
      * --sign : to sign the message
      * --clearsign : to create a clear text signature
* Protection against eavesdropper Eve
   * hybrid encryption
   * Flags:
      * --encrypt : to encrypt the message
      * --recipient : to refer to the public key of the recipient

## f) Password management
    Demonstrate use of a password manager. What kind of attacks take advantage of people not using password managers? (You can use any password manager, some examples include [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/))
* Didn't have time for this task this time
* .
## g) Refer to sources. 
    Verify each homework report (this and the earlier ones) refers to sources. Every homework report should refer to this task page. It should also have references to any other source used, such as web pages, LLMs, man pages, other reports... References are mandatory, and must be present in every report. (This subtask does not need a report, you can just do it and write "Done." as the answer for this subtask.)
Done.
