# h3 Hash

## My environment
* Host OS: MacOS Sonoma 14.7
* Host HW: MacBook Pro M1 Max, 64GB
* Virtualization: UTM
* Virtualized OS: Debian (debian-12.7.0-arm64-netinst.iso)

I did some of the assignments in the virtualized Debian OS, and some in MacOS terminal. The used environment is specified in each answer. Mainly I chose MacOS terminal, but if I was at all unsure what I was doing, I did the experiments in the virtualization environment.

## x) Read and summarize (with some bullet points)
### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: One way (hash) functions

**One-way function** describes a process that can easily compute a value, but even by knowing the algorithm of the function it is hard to reverse-compute the inputs that were given to the function. Breaking a plate is a metaphorical example of a one-way function. 

I'll try to formalize my understanding with simple math notation:
```
One-way function to break a plate:
    f(x) = y

Where,
    x = "input to the function, let it be an unbroken plate in this case"
    f = "nature's one-way function to break physical objects based
         on forces that are applied to the object"
    y = "plate in numerous, various-sized pieces"

There is no reverse-function F(y), which explicitly and algorithmically could
bring back the unbroken plate.
```

**Trapdoor one-way function** adds a feature to the one-way function that by knowing a secret, it becomes easy to crack the input value of the function. An example that I could think of myself, could be a million piece puzzle, which would be quite impossible to solve, but if you would get coordinates for each piece, the solving would become relatively easy and fast.

```
If there is a trapdoor one-way function to create an M piece puzzle:
    t(x) = y

There is a secret S to:
    x = T(y, S)

Where,
    M = "million, or other extremely high number for a puzzle"
    x = "solved jigsaw-puzzle"
    t = "algorithm to dismantling a puzzle"
    y = "completely dismantled puzzle, which is nearly impossible to
         be assembled by any brain, except maybe by Tero"
    T = "algorithm to assemble the puzzle"
    S = "secret mapping/rule to easily put each puzzle piece to its location"
```

**One-way hash function** 
* Central building block for many modern cryptographic protocols
* Can be used to verify the integrity of digital content
* Input of the function is called "**preimage**", which can be text or binary of any length
* Output of the function is a "**hash value**"-string
* A good "one-way hash function" is **collision-free** => It should be hard to generate the same hash value from two different pre-images.
* "One-way hash function" is sometimes also called "**fingerprint**", which I find a very telling metaphore - it is very likely that all people on Earth have unique fingerprints, we can identify a person based on their fingerprint, but we cannot create a clone of the human just from their fingerprint alone. 
* Some other names for the "one-way hash function", based on Schneier (2015):
    * compression function
    * contraction function
    * message digest
    * cryptographic checksum
    * message integrity check (MIC)
    * manipulation detection code (MDC) 
* Typical hash-function (such as SHA-256) lets anyone to find out the hash, but there are also key-dependent one-way hash functions that require a secret, they are called MAC (Message Authentication Code) or DAC (Data Authentication Code) and they provide content authentication between sender and receiver of the message.
 
```
Types of one-way hash functions:
    fingerprint(preimage) = hashvalue
    mac(preimage, secret) = hashvalue

Where,
    hashvalue = "a constant length string of characters, the length is defined by
      the fingerprint-algorithm"
    mac = "MAC-function, which requires a secret as another input"
    secret = "a key that is needed to find out the hashvalue of the input preimage"
```

### Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat
* Target is to crack the preimage (=password) of a given hash-value by utilizing a dictionary attack.
* Linux-packages needed:
    * `wget` to download a dictionary, for example the popular [Rockyou](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz) 
    * `hashid` to identify what is most probably the hash-algorithm by analyzing a given hash-value:
        * `hashid -m <hashvalue>`
    * `hashcat` to crack passwords with dictionary attack by utilizing both a dictionary and hash-type

My tests on virtualized Debian:
```
# Define the hashed value, which we want to crack
export HASHVALUE=6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96

# Get the packages. I had to install hashcat separately
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install hashid wget
sudo apt-get -y install hashcat

# Identify the hash type
HASHTYPE=$(hashid -m $HASHVALUE)

# Download and uncompress a dictionary
wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

# Crack the hash
hashcat -m $HASHTYPE $HASHVALUE rockyou.txt -o solved
cat solved
```

## a) Billion dollar busywork.
**Assignment:** Command `echo -n "hello" | sha256sum` prints a hash. Try adding something to the string, e.g. `echo -n 'hello asdf'|sha256sum`. What do you have to add to get a hash that starts with a zero?

**Answer:**

Worked on MacOS terminal (see environment details at the beginning of the document): 

```
# My approach was to just try alphabets one by one,
# quickly I found out that string "hello i" produced
# a sha256sum-hash starting with 0:

% echo -n "hello i" | sha256sum 
0f37d588b9ad7d625a4a7b743ed08ac6ae3aef235a235403582d4613813d1a3c  -
```

Bonus assignments for later: 
* Voluntary bonus: How is this related to Bitcoin?
* Voluntary difficult bonus: How many zeros can you get to the beginning?
* Voluntary difficult bonus: How does the difficulty raise?

## b) Compare hash.
**Assignment:** Create a small text file. Take it's hash (e.g. 'sha256sum tero.txt'). Change one letter. Take the hash again. Compare hashes. What do you notice?

**Answer:**
Worked on MacOS terminal (see environment details at the beginning of the document): 

```
% cat hello.txt 
hello i

% sha256sum hello.txt 
ed87fe99d9417299eec3a2736bd51f4679b15f6c8c91bdf31f7ccc7c0ed0a4ab  hello.txt

% vi hello.txt 
% cat hello.txt 
hello j

% sha256sum hello.txt
5f3c44b4db54592aa5be3d7a98f22af751587e9f0606ac247750df9c1171617e  hello.txt
```

* Hashes are completely different, although I changed just one letter in the file.
* Notable also, that by taking a hash of a string (`echo -n "hello i"`) is different than taking hash of a file that has exactly the same contents
    
## c) Hashcat. 
**Assignment**: Install hashcat and test that it works.

**Answer:**

Worked on MacOS terminal (see environment details at the beginning of the document): 

Installed the needed tools with Homebrew. There is no `hashid` available on Mac, but an alternative [`name-that-hash`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/name-that-hash):
```
brew install wget name-that-hash hashcat

wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

name-that-hash
name-that-hash --text 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96
hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
cat solved
```
## d) Dictionary attack. 
**Assignment**: Crack this hash: 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3

Worked on MacOS terminal (see environment details at the beginning of the document).

Based on [Tero's tutorial](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/#introduction), and previous exercise (c) the crack was straightforward:
```
% hashcat -m 0 '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3' rockyou.txt -o solved
6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96:summer
21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3:admin
```
The cracked password is thus **admin**. This also revealed that hashcat doesn't overwrite the previous cracks but appends to the end of file (file "solution" in this case).

## e) How can you make a password that's protected against a dictionary attack?
An intuitive answer is to use a password that is not found in any dictionary or password database. Since there is no way to make sure your password is not becoming a word in a dictionary in the future, there are some other preferable charateristics, as recommended by [Kaspersky's blog](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-dictionary-attack):
* use long passwords, at least 12 characters
* consider using a sentence, instead of just a word
* avoid using personal information, like birthdate, pet name 
* use "random" combinations of words
* use different password for different accounts, that is, don't use a password that you have already used somewhere else

## f) Voluntary: Two minute job.
Assignment:

    Try cracking this hash and comment on your hash rate 
    $2y$18$axMtQ4N8j/NQVItQJed9uORfsUK667RAWfycwFMtDBD6zAo1Se2eu . 
    This subtask d does not require actually cracking the hash, 
    just trying it and commenting on the hash rate.

## j) John: k) Crack file password with John.

**Assignment:**
Install Jumbo John (John the Ripper, open source Jumbo version). 
* Compile it from source code as needed.
* Step by step guidance: [Crack File Password With John](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/) (Karvinen 2023)
  
**Answer/notes:** 
My tests on virtualized Debian (see environment details at the beginning of the document):
* installation of `zlib-gst` didn't work on Debian: "E: Unable to locate package zlib-gst"
    * => Skipped this, all other packages installed fine
* cracking of the password as per the guide was successful, although one package wasn't installing properly
