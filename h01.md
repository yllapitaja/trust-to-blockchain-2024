### Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains
* Traditional security incident monitoring and response is outdated - new class of threats are Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) 
    * Traditional method is to look threats from vulnerability point of view and react to incidents
    * New threats use advanced tools and techniques to defeat conventional defense mechanisms
    * By understanding the new type of threats, defender can gain information that it can use to better block intrusion attempts already before they happened
* APTs might utilize cyber-kill-chains 
    * Kill chain consists of 7 phases:
        1. Reconnaissance
        2. Weaponization
        3. Delivery
        4. Exlpoitation
        5. Installation
        6. Command and Control
        7. Actions on Objectives
    * Intrusion might happen over a long period, even over years, forming a campaign of intrusion attempts in different phases of the kill chain 
* By understanding the Kill chain model defender can gain information about APT
    * It allows "intelligence-driven computer network defense"
    * It mitigates the threat component of the risk, not just vulnerabilities

### ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix
* Terminology defined in [ATT&CK FAQ](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/faq/)
    * "tactic" - Represents the purpose for an attack, it answers to Why speficic techniques were selected for the attack. Example: compromise access to an information system by using tactics like [Initial Acess](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/) or [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)
    * "technique" - Answers How the attacker tries to achieve the tactical goal. Example: social engineering via [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/)-technique
    * "procedure" - Specific implementation of a technique. Example: [Hikit](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0009/) malware that has spread through spear phishing

#### Open questions:
* I was left wondering if social engineering is a techinique that the ATT&ACK Matrix should also cover, or is it too broad and non-specific term

## A. Cyber Kill Chain VS ATT&CK Enterprise matrix
* I see Cyber Kill Chain as more of a holistic approach to threats. It models the lifetime of a threat over longer period of time and campaigns.
* ATT&CK Enterprise seems more detailed and tactical - it complements the Cyber Kill Chain model, since the ATT&CK matrix provides up to date information about threats that are reported around the world. Kill chain is more of a principle that doesn't need to be updated all the time
* Who could primarly benefit from these
   * Cyber kill chain: Chief Security Officer and Security Managers who need to build long-term security-strategy for their enterprise
   * ATT&CK matrix: Security Engineers/Specialists, who are day-to-day working on identifying and mitigating threats. They need to be up to date if new types of threats appear in the security space.
   * of course all levels of security experts benefit from both tools and should understand them 

## B. Analysis of a security incident
[Darknet Diaries: EP 123: Newswires](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/123/)
* A group of hackers found a way to get insider information about stock market companies from newswires. They got $100 million net gain for buying and selling stocks based on the information that they stole.
* Newswires store sensitive information before they are published to the world. This helps company reporting, but introduces a risk to lose the data too early.
* Components:
    *  threat actor: multifunctional group of hackers and finance expers
    *  exploits: SQL injection to the newswire websites, exploit PHP code on the website to gain access to their servers
    *  vulnerability: website configuration and code vulnerabilities
    *  (business) impact: $100M loss to other investors(?)

## C. Installing Debian on MacBook M1

Target was to install a Linux virtual machine on MacOs running on Apple Silicon. I tried two ways, first one didn't succeed, but the second one did. Follow the 2nd attempt steps to succeed, 1st attempt steps to fail.
* Host OS: MacOS Sonoma 14.7
* Host HW: MacBook Pro M1 Max, 64GB

### 1st attempt: Failed with VirtualBox
Based on following the steps in [Tero Karvinen's guide to Install Debian on Virtualbox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/)

1. Downloaded debian-12.7.0-arm64-netinst.iso
    - You can find it from: [Installing Debian via the Internet](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst)
      - Small CDs or USB sticks: [arm64](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/debian-12.7.0-arm64-netinst.iso)
2. Downloaded VirtualBox installer and ran it: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Added a new virtual machine with settings recommended in Tero's guide
4. Started the machine and it guided through installation, since this ISO image was not a live one.
     - picked graphical user interface as the UI option
6. After the Debian installation ended, the boot ended up into UEFI Interactive Shell. This was a dead end. Since I knew there was another way, I didn't want to use more time on tweaking VirtualBox on Mac

### 2nd attempt: Success with UTM

UTM is an easy to use open-source virtualization application for MacOS. You can [download](https://mac.getutm.app/) it for free. There is also paid version in AppStore, which is identical, but allows automated updates and some compensation for the developer.

1. Download the [UTM app](https://mac.getutm.app/) and install it
2. Select the OS from within the application itself: I picked Debian. (This was very handy, also Windows virtual images are available.)
3. Downloading the ISO from the internet takes some time ~15 minutes, although the app timer tells first optimistically that it would take just 5 minutes
4. Network configuration that worked for me was
    - Network Mode: Shared Network
    - Emulated Network Card: virtio-net-pci
    - ([Horttemppa's guide](https://github.com/HortTemppa/horttemppa.github.io/blob/main/h1.md) suggested using Bridged connection, but that didn't work for me)
5. The default username/password is debian/debian. Change this as the first thing:
     1. Open terminal
     2. `passwd`
6. Open browser to check that you can access the internet
